## Usage

Instantiate the client by the following
```
client = ActiveCampaignV3Api::Client.new(api_token: <YOUR_API_TOKEN>, account_id: <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>
```

Your account ID is the ID that was associated with your account.

While your API Token can be found under `Settings` > `Developer` (Alternatively you can visit https://<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>.activehosted.com/app/settings/developer)

After that, refer to the documentations for the method's name. For example, if you want to create a group. Refer to the document here: https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference#groups . The method name is take from the endpoint's title and converted into snakecase (e.g. "Create a group" -> "create_a_group")

Therefore you can call the method by

```
client.create_a_group(data)
```

The number of arguments needed for each method will be dependent on the endpoint that was being called.

1. If the endpoint does not require id and data, then there will be no argument
Example: https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference#list-all-groups

```
client.list_all_groups
```

2. If the endpoint require only id, then there will be 1 argument

```
id = 1
client.retrieve_a_group(id)
```

3. If the endpoint require only data, then there will be 1 argument

```
data = { group: { title: 'Testing' } }
client.retrieve_a_group(data)
```

4. If the endpoint require both id and data, then there will be 2 arguments. Id will be the first followed by Data

```
id = 1
data = { group: { title: 'Testing' } }
client.update_a_group(id, data)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
